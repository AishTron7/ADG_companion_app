# The ADG companion app

This is an all-in-one app that displays the current projects of ADG, the members list and a *__scrollable__* images gallery.

Some features of this flutter project are:
1. Proper working navigation bar
2. __This app has integration with image assets!__
3. The selected navigation section gets highlighted in amber color.
4. The app bar changes with change in the navigation area.
5. The app bar also contains a button which has potential to be used as in editing a list.
6. The image gallery has multiple images *__related to ADG__* that are scrollable.

* The projects list currently contains "Website for Kasturba Hospital" project further different projects can be added in this list.
* Please note that there is still scope of work in the gallery UI section and the members list needs to be filled.
* This work is part of my task phase for ADG :)
